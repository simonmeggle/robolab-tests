Objective: Empty the basket before starting the test 

Key Learnings: 
- "then"-Assertions in Browser library

Even if Playwright always starts the browser with a new "incognito" profile, a test should never rely
on preconditions but take care for them. In our case, we should not rely on an empty basket - if there
is already something in, the total price will not be the expected one. 
For this, we introduce another keyword "empty basket" and call it in the test.
There is no need to create a keyword for this task, but it comes with multiple benefits: 
- both the code and result log are more readable
- It makes the code reusable.
- The keyword encapsulation allows to monitor the runtime in Checkmk.

#  !!ACTION: First, run the test and check if it is working. Then set a breakpoint at the line with "BREAKPOINT", 
# run the test and add an item to the basket. Then continue the execution to check if the basket gets cleared.
