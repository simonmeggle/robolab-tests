Objective: test3  (article search)

Key Learnings: 
- Multiple Arguments
- CSS chaining
- Comparing strings

The third test should search for a specific article ID and check if the ordering process until before payment works.
It is highly recommended to store such dynamic data in variables instead of hardcoding them into the test. 

#  !!ACTION: Debug the 3rd test case and inspect the selectors. Change ARTICLE_PRICE and see if the error message is correct.
